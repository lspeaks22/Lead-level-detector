#pb-level-detector

A python script that cleans and formats messy lead surveillance data for better analysis.

This is a GUI tool that reads, analyzes, and flags elevated lead levels in environmental or clinical datasets.This project was inspired by my work at the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), where I supported the Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, Surveillance Unit.
