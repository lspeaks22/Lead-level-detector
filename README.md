#pb-level-detector

A python script that cleans and formats messy lead surveillance data for better analysis.

This is a GUI tool that reads, analyzes, and flags elevated lead levels in environmental or clinical datasets.This project was inspired by my work at the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), where I supported the Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, Surveillance Unit. 

Example

If you upload this:

| Name         | Address                                     | Lead Level |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| John Doe     | 123 Main St, Baltimore, MD 21201            | 4.2        |

Youâ€™ll get this:

| Name         | Address                   | Lead Level | Lead Flag | Street Address | City      | State | Zip Code (from Address) |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------|--------------------------|
| John Doe     | 123 Main St, Baltimore... | 4.2        | High      | 123 Main St    | Baltimore | MD    | 21201                   |

And the `"Lead Level"` and `"Lead Flag"` cells will be highlighted in **red**.
